# **Beverage Industry Sales Analysis and Forecasting Proposal**

## **Project Overview**

Comprehensive data analytics project leveraging your beverage industry sales dataset to extract actionable insights, develop predictive models, and create interactive visualizations. This project will focus on understanding sales distribution patterns, forecasting future sales, and building a dashboard to monitor key performance indicators.

## **Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

The EDA will analyze how total sales distribute across various dimensions, including:

- **Product Category Analysis**: Comparing sales performance between soft drinks and alcoholic beverages
- **Customer Segmentation**: Analyzing differences in purchasing patterns between B2B and B2C customers
- **Regional Performance**: Identifying high and low-performing regions
- **Seasonal Trends**: Detecting monthly, quarterly, and annual sales patterns
- **Discount Impact**: Evaluating how discounts affect total sales for B2B customers
- **Product Performance**: Ranking products by sales volume and revenue
- **Order Analysis**: Examining order sizes, frequencies, and customer purchasing habits

## **Phase 2: Predictive Modeling**

I recommend developing multiple models to predict total sales:

1. **Multiple Linear Regression**: To identify key variables influencing sales
2. **Time Series Analysis**:
    - **ARIMA/SARIMA**: To capture seasonal patterns and trends
    - **Prophet**: For detecting multiple seasonality patterns and handling holidays
3. **Machine Learning Models**:
    - **Random Forest**: For capturing non-linear relationships
    - **XGBoost**: For high-performance prediction with feature importance

Model performance will be evaluated using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared, with cross-validation to ensure reliability.

## **Phase 3: PowerBI Dashboard Development**

The interactive dashboard will include:

- **Sales Overview**: Total revenue, units sold, average order value
- **Time Series Visualization**: Sales trends with seasonal decomposition
- **Geographic Performance**: Regional sales map with drill-down capabilities
- **Customer Insights**: B2B vs B2C comparison metrics
- **Product Performance**: Top/bottom performing products
- **Forecasting View**: Projected sales with confidence intervals
- **What-If Analysis**: Interactive tools to simulate scenarios (pricing changes, discount strategies)

## **Expected Outcomes**

- Comprehensive understanding of sales distribution across key dimensions
- Accurate sales forecasting models with quantifiable precision
- Interactive dashboard for real-time decision support
- Actionable insights for inventory management, marketing strategies, and business planning
- Identification of growth opportunities by region, product, and customer segment

This project will provide valuable intelligence to optimize pricing strategies, improve customer targeting, manage seasonal fluctuations, and ultimately drive revenue growth.
